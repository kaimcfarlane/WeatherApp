# WeatherApp
 This is a weather application that displays the climate info within a city. This includes data, namely forecast, temperature, and local time. I've also added some features like a dark-mode, a metric/customary setting, and the ability to turn icons into words. This App was built using the OpenWeatherAPI, IPGeolocation API, and CSS/HTML/JavaScript.
