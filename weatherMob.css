@media (max-width: 450px) {
}
/* Main title needs to be smaller
could maybe just always have active class for search bar
The search Thingy needs to be changed maybe some type of display none because the hover animation doesn't work 
The revealed is okay but the background box needs to be wider.
Wehn we actually see on mobile we need to adjust the height of information shown 
Temperature also needs to be a bit smaller so it can fit all on one line 
Lastly the exapned stuff may need to be expanded further. Probably can adjust the width on that in css. */
